  # Assume that "str" is a sequence of words separated by spaces.
  # Return a string in which every word in "str" that exceeds 4 characters is replaced with "marklar".
  # If the word being replaced has a capital first letter, it should instead be replaced with "Marklar".

  # Return the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, up to
  # the "nth" term in the sequence
